## Meeting notes
Note-taker: Andrea

### Business
- GitHub usernames
- Updates for next time
- Rescheduling 12/19: choose date? Tuesday 12/17 10am-12pm
- January showcase dates? 
  - Alice will come up with potential dates and send a Doodle poll
- Note-taking logistics: markdown & github
- Python community of learning
  - Off Thursdays 10-11 or 12
  - Coordinator for spring semester?
- [Book Traces project presentation](https://www.brynmawr.edu/events/book-traces-digital-research-history-reading) - Monday, 4:30-6:00 PM, Special Collections Seminar Room
  - They use an app sheet app to collect their data - very user friendly.  Opportunity to learn about potentially relevant skills for us.  Can include attendance to DH events in weekly updates. 

### Discussion
- All DGSA present
- TO DO before next meeting: write a short update about what we’ve been doing between meetings.  Send by Wednesday evening - put in the “Updates” section.
- Python community of learning 
   - Can start this semester if enough people are interested.  One of the DSGA should take the lead. Alice and Devin have Python experience. Other tools: classical languages toolkit, natural languages processing.  Opportunity for text analysis work in Python. Advantage of Python: most readable and most accessible, good for beginners, not very complicated, very versatile, can be used for web development, some ArcGIS applications. Meet on our “off” Thursdays from 10-12 - starting next week.  
- Personal goals
  - Molly: learning Python and how it applies, what type of work grad students might be expected to do on DH projects
  - Katie: becoming more familiar with GIS programs, text editors, data management, has some familiarity with ArcGIS and may be able to do a program on this in the spring.  Learn QGIS (free! But slightly less user friendly) and the differences with ArcGIS
  - Devin: R, java script, learning what other systems are available/useful
  - RJ: visualizing data, text analysis
  - Andrea: mapping, database creation, data visualization
- Some ideas on how to create maps (interactive maps): 
  - Alice: story maps, leaflet JS (?)
- Project management & goals
  - How to describe a project and learn what specific skills you need to learn how to do that
  - Next time: come up with more specific goals and a step-by-step plan to get there (e.g., tutorials), edit the fall 2019 goals.  Can also add workshop ideas and include initials. 
- Code.org videos 
  - Helpful introduction to how computers work, simplicity but complexity of the systems!  History of computer construction, Penn early computer model, similarities of binary system and written language - computational language and written languages are more similar than we think (patterns), computers are only as powerful as we make them - people tell computers what to do, AI, biases in programs exist because people write programs (master/servant, male/female vocabulary built into programming language and computer terminology)



### Command line
- Installations:
  - [Xcode/git](https://github.com/tri-cods/install/blob/master/sections/git.md)
  - [Atom](https://github.com/tri-cods/install/blob/master/sections/atom.md)
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/tri-cods/command-line) from 2019 Tri-Co DSRI

#### Resources
- [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash), Ian Milligan and James Baker, The Programming Historian
- [The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) (for more advanced tutorials, see the “Loops” and “Shell Scripts” sections)
- [Terminus command line game](http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) (a fantasy choose-your-own adventure like game) (good for getting use to navigating file structures--uses only a few commands)
- https://vim-adventures.com/
- https://codecombat.com/

### For next time
- [ ] Command line practice & review
  - Finish your command line mini-projects
  - [Introduction to the Bash Command Line](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-bash) from Programming Historian
  - Optional: command line games
- [ ] Refine your goals
- [ ] Readings on DH in your discipline
  - [Archaeology, the Digital Humanities, and the 'Big Tent'](https://dhdebates.gc.cuny.edu/read/untitled/section/abdd0db0-2eaa-4af7-aac3-7f24ca70ed3b), Ethan Watrall, *Debates in the Digital Humanities 2016* (Minnesota UP: 2016)
  - ["Digital Methods and Classical Studies"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/2/000253/000253.html), Bernstein and Coffee, DHQ 10.2 (2016)
- [ ] Familiarize yourself with the major tools, methods, and platforms for digital research in your field or subfield  
  - Identify conferences or communities doing work that you’re interested in and major projects/institutions/people in this field
