## Agenda
1. Business

## Updates

Katie. Signed up for a Domain of Your Own, on 11/21. kbreyer.digital.brynmawr.edu. On Friday 11/22, I went to the talk about making a Makerspace at Bryn Mawr College with Yusi.

Devin: I began poking around the CLTK tutorials. It ended up being a bit of a nightmare because CLTK doesn't run on Windows, so I spent a lot of time trying to remedy that issue. I'm hoping that since I got all that sorted out, I can begin working with the tutorials in the next few weeks.
