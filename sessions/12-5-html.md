## Updates

Katie. Signed up for a Domain of Your Own, on 11/21. kbreyer.digital.brynmawr.edu. On Friday 11/22, I went to the talk about making a Makerspace at Bryn Mawr College with Yusi. I am still not sure what I specifically want to do for m spring workshops, and need to look into tutorials for Quantum GIS, and possibly teaching a workshop about Open Source resources and sites that archaeologists can (and should) use in place of commerical or university sponsored programs. I plan to do further research into Open Access resources for archaeologists and I think it might be beneficial to have a workshop for archaeology grads and undergrads concerning the topic, the resources, and the debate surrounding the use of Open Access tools v. Commerical/For-Profit tools.

Devin: I began poking around the CLTK tutorials. It ended up being a bit of a nightmare because CLTK doesn't run on Windows, so I spent a lot of time trying to remedy that issue. I'm hoping that since I got all that sorted out, I can begin working with the tutorials in the next few weeks.

Molly: I met with Alice about potential projects, and identifying what sort of tools I would need to acquire to work on them. I identified some sites that map locations in texts with interactive tools that allow people to experience texts with visual context, and a tool called "Histograph", the code for which is published on github. I have identified some places where I can learn Python and Javascript, updated my goals, and now will start building the skills I need.

RJ: I too poked around the Classical languages toolkit. I still felt a bit out of my depth but I plan to continue reading up on it and Python. I also looked into how best to begin working in R. Again, it looks like I need to better my knowledge of Python before jumping in.
