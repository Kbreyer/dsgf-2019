## Updates
1. Book Traces presentation, Nov. 11 (Andrea):
  Looking at pre-1923 books that were donated to colleges and are still in circulation (not in special collections) to study marginalia, insertions, dedications, and other additions to the text before the books were donated to the college.  Goal to study reader interaction and readerly practices with the books in the 19th century in select university libraries and show that these books are unique artifacts and not simply “duplicates” that can be removed from the library collection.  Their project creates a list of books in the library that fit their criteria, sends students to look through those books for reader interventions, then take photos of the interventions through an app.  The app incorporates information from a spreadsheet that functions as a checklist, then uploads photos of the interventions to a Google Drive.  The dataset is a collection of photos that must be studied and a list of which books do/do not have reader interventions, but not what those interventions are.  Discussed more meaningful ways to develop the app (putting more information in the data collection interface) and what the researchers want to do with the data once acquired, which will impact the data collection methodology.  Also discussed the possibilities of sharing this information with libraries and what that would look like.
