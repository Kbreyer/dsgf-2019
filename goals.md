# Fall 2019 goals & ideas

## Collective

## Individual

### Andrea
1. Read Ch 2: Computing for Archaeologists and Ch 15: Databases in “A Companion to Digital Humanities,” 2004
2. Research Google Earth Enterprise (e.g., GitHUb page), learn what tools I need to use it and whether it’s the best platform for my research and goals
3. Research other database platforms with mapping components
4. Think of possible undergrad workshops in mapping
5. Reacquaint myself with ArcGIS - watch tutorials
6. Learn more about the Votive Project and figure out how to become part of their community
7. Learn more about the UNSALA (Unlocking Sacred Landscapes) and figure out how to become part of their community
8. Look at Sarah Bond’s digital mapping tutorials

### Devin

1. Investigate applications of Python to Digital Humanities (most likely Classical Studies Toolkit) through tutorials (University of Iowa PowerPoint and CSTK GitHub repository)
2. Work through three chapters of the R For Dummies book by the end of the semester

### Katie

My overall goals for the following months include:

1. Become more familiar with sites and programs such as: ArcGIS, ArcMap, SketchFab, etc. (watch tutorials, etc.)
2. Think about potential workshops that relate to these programs and 3D modeling (3D scanning nad photogrammetry)
3. Talk to my digital archaeology professor about using our class data and syllabus for a more condensed workshop version.
4. Redesign my "Digital Files Database" spreadsheet that I made for my digital archaology class and share it with everyone
5. Learn about digitial pedogogy and what that entails and how I can integrate the theories/approaches in future TA and teaching roles

### Molly
Goals: 
  1. Become acquainted with the world of CS and Digital Humanities.
  2. Identify the skillset I would need to attempt the type of projects I have in mind.
  3. Having identified that I would need skills in Python, JavaScript and Leaflet GIS I will:
      A. Complete "Python Programming for the Humanities" and attend the biweekly meetings to learn Python.
      B. Complete "The Programming Historian"'s guide to mapping with Python and Leaflet.
      C. Identify a course to learn JavaScript and work through at least half of it.

### RJ

General areas and specific tools
1. Data management (R)
2. Text analysis (Python and Classical Languages Toolkit)
3. Visualizing data (Python and (perhaps) Leaflet)

Possible applications 
1. Use data management to better store and organize my current research archives (esp. my dissertation archive)
2. Use text analysis to analyze the phonetic patterns of greek Hymns (esp. the voces magicae in the Greek magical papyri, for an article I am preparing).
3. Possible project: use data management and data visualization tools in order to create a webmapped database of the community of extant or non-extant ancient authors - sortable by their dates, where they worked, travelled, and were born as well as by their genres, and whatever else identifying marker might be found useful for scholars. This could ultimately be used to map intellectual networks which might otherwise be obscured by the shadow cast by the modern canon of ancient authors.
